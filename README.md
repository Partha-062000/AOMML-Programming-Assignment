Neural Network Optimization Project
Overview
This project investigates neural network optimization through two interconnected studies: a benchmark analysis of traditional optimizers and implementation of a novel Mixed Phase Optimizer.
Key Components
1. Benchmark Study
A comparative analysis of four optimization algorithms across CNN and RNN architectures:

- Optimizers Evaluated: Adam, RMSprop, SGD with momentum, and Adagrad
- Architectures: CNN for image classification (MNIST) and RNN for sentiment analysis (IMDB)
- Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, convergence speed, training time

Key Functions:

- Optimizer configuration and initialization
- Training and validation loops with metric tracking
- Performance visualization and comparison

2. Mixed Phase Optimizer
A novel optimizer that transitions between different optimization strategies during training.
Core Concept:
The Mixed Phase Optimizer dynamically shifts between three distinct phases:

- Phase 1 (Adam-like): Rapid initial convergence via second-order adaptive optimization
- Phase 2 (RMSprop-like): Balanced progress via first-order adaptive methods
- Phase 3 (SGD with momentum): Final fine-tuning with stable gradient descent

Key Functions:

- Phase transition management based on iteration count
- State synchronization between optimization phases
- Parameter and momentum buffer management
- PyTorch integration via native optimizer classes

3. Training and Evaluation
The project includes a comprehensive framework for model training and evaluation.
Key Features:

- Data loading and preprocessing for MNIST and IMDB datasets
- Model architecture implementation for CNN and RNN
- Training utilities with early stopping and validation
- Performance visualization across training phases
- Comparative analysis tools for optimizer benchmarking

Main Findings

1. Optimizer Hierarchy: Consistent performance ranking (Adam > RMSprop > SGD > Adagrad) across architectures
2. Architecture Dependency: Performance gaps between optimizers are more pronounced in RNNs than CNNs
3. Mixed Phase Benefits: The phase-transitioning approach successfully combines:

- Fast initial convergence (adaptive methods)
- Stable later-stage training (first-order methods)
- Smooth transitions between optimization strategies


4. Architecture-Specific Behavior: The Mixed Phase Optimizer works well for CNNs but requires modifications for effective RNN optimization

Practical Applications
This research enables better decision-making for neural network training:

- General Purpose Training: Adam remains the most consistently effective optimizer
- Limited Computation: Adaptive methods offer faster initial convergence
- CNN Applications: Both Adam and the Mixed Phase Optimizer provide excellent performance
- RNN Applications: Standard Adam currently outperforms the Mixed Phase implementation

Future Directions

- Architecture-specific modifications to the Mixed Phase Optimizer
- Data-driven mechanisms for phase transition timing
- Integration of specialized optimizers as phase components
- Extension to transformer architectures and other complex models

Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.13.1+
- NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
